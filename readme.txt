XCompare is a tool that can be used for very fast comparison of Excel tables.

Its main benefits and the purposes for which this tool was made are:
- it can compare Excel tables that have very different structure - especially with different order of columns and/or rows and
  different headers.
- Fully automatic comparison process if both tables have identical column names. In this case, the tool will mark all discovered
  differences directly in the Excel files (via OLE).
- since version 2, this app is also able to find and visualize relations between columns across the tables.

Note: XCompare utilizes the Microsoft Excel application (through OLE interprocess communication) so make sure you have it
installed before using XCompare. This way, XCompare can mark all the found differences directly in the open XLS(X) documents.
