XCompare is a tool that can be used for very fast comparison of Excel tables.
Its main benefits (and the reasons why this app was made) are:
- it can compare tables that have very different structure (different names of columns, different order of columns and/or rows, 
  or different number of rows in headers
- fast comparison if the structure is similar. In this case, the tool is able to automatically distinguish and mark differences - directly in the tables by changing of their background color.
